#' Human population density  for Bangladesh
#'
#'  Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4) Population Density consists of estimates of human population density based on counts consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2015.  A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 12.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, is used to assign population values to 30 arc-second (~1 km) grid cells. The population density grids are created by dividing the population count grids by the land area grids. The pixel values represent persons per square kilometer.  The global raster from SEDAC was cropped and masked to the country of Bangladesh.
